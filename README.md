LightLLM is a Python-based LLM (Large Language Model) inference and serving framework, notable for its lightweight design, easy scalability, and high-speed performance. LightLLM harnesses the strengths of numerous well-regarded open-source implementations, including but not limited to FasterTransformer, TGI, vLLM, and FlashAttention.
